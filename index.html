        <h3>About Byron</h3>
        <p>Born and raised in New Jersey. 
          I have always had an interest in STEM, even going to school to get a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry. 
          In my third year, I was hospitalized twice and went on a haiatus from school.</p>
        <p>From that point I have gone from job to job trying to get all of my bills paid off.
          Two years later I had only made a sizable dent, so I had to figure something out.</p>
        <p>I had coded in the past and remembered the joy I had doing it.
          So I decided to join Thinkful's program to redirect my life into a software development career.
          As I go through my journey, I am realizign how much I enjoy it and actually don't mind doing it as a career.</p>
        <p>I am trying to break into the VR/AR space someday, but for today. I'll just take it one step at a time.</p>
